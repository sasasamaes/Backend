## 📋 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

0. Install Docker and Docker Compose
1. Download the Hasura global binary. See steps [here](https://hasura.io/docs/2.0/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/)
2. Run 

```shell

docker compose up -d
```

3. Connect with database. For this run `hasura console` and follow this [guide](https://hasura.io/docs/2.0/databases/quickstart/#on-hasura-deployed-via-docker)

Connect using an environment variable and just type `PG_DATABASE_URL`

Name your database as `safetrust` (instead of default) when prompted to do so.

Now, run the migrations.

```shell
hasura migrate apply --admin-secret myadminsecretkey
```

4. Adding migrations.

You can add migrations either with the hasura console or by the command:

```shell
hasura migrate create [enable_postgis] --admin-secret myadminsecretkey
```

where `enable_postgis` is the name of the migration. Please make sure to use descriptive names with verbs about what the migration is doing!

Then to apply them:

```shell
cd ..
```

If you wanna use the hasura web console and access it on `http://localhost:9695/`:


```shell
hasura console --admin-secret myadminsecretkey
```

And you should be good to go to start and work on this.
